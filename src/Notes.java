		//Why main method in Java written as static and void?
		//Void-->
		//Main method is being called by JVM and excution starts from there on. 
		//JVM cannot anything further with the return type of main method.  
		//Static-->
		//Main method is always defined as static because we never create object of main method class to run it.
		//It is the JVM responsibility to start the execution from main method automaticaly.
